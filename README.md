This is an altered version of the [Doki Doki AI Edition](https://github.com/doki-doki-ai-edition/Mod) that uses [Groq](https://console.groq.com/docs/quickstart)--which as of writing this is completely free to use.

If Groq ever requires a paid sub then this repo will be archived or deleted to comply with Team Salvato's IP Guidelines.




## Groq

**Overview:** Groq is an API that let's you run a few open sourced models such as llama3, mixtral, mistral  etc. at amazing speeds. 

**Let's start**

- Go to https://console.groq.com/login
- Signup with your whichever account you want
- Go to https://console.groq.com/keys
- Click "Create API Key"
- Copy the key **and make sure you save it somewhere**

In DDAE click on settings and make sure "AI Type" is set to "API"
